installing ta-lib can be annoying:
steps to install ta-lib:
1. download the right talib verion for your system from: https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/releases
2. paste the .whl file in C:/users/(whatever)
3. now run the command pip install ta-lib

Similarly install other libraries and your good to go! (others arent much of a hazzle)
